### 09\18
- Learining how to  build an emulator (1.5 hours)
### 09\19
- Search for information about SOLIDAC(1 hour)
### 09\20
- Learning about CPU instruction execution, arithmetic and logic operations, as well as how the CPU interacts with other hardware.(2 hours)
### 09\21
- First meeting with supervisor, asked about the function of SOLIDAC (1hour)
### 09\26
- Finish reading the first fifty pages of the literature, and I have gained a general understanding of the components, functionality, and the initial purpose of constructing SOLIDAC. (3 hours)
### 09\27
- Continuing to review the literature on SOLIDAC, and documenting points of uncertainty and intend to raise them during my next meeting with the supervisor. (2 hours)
### 09\28
- Thinking about implementation plan, keep reading the matrials of SOlIDAC (1.5 hours)
### 09\29
- Draw a GUI frontend diagram of the system and try to determine the inputs and outputs of SOLIDAC (1.5 hours)
### 10\01
- Try to figure out the out put of each switch, they only mentioned in material when they were used, think about how to implement the clock
  CPU. (1 hour)
### 10\02
- Decide to bulid a web based program and learn more about the content of JavaScript.(1 hour)
### 10\04
- Thinking about how to write a simple function to interpret instructions. (30mins)
### 10\06
- Learning how to build a simple interpreter in https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part2/ (2 hours)
### 10\09
- Starting implement order code (1 hour)
### 10\10
- Finished first two orders.start from B-reg to store. (1 hour)
- Asked supervisor about how do the switches and indicator lights work, and thinking about how to link all the methods to the interface after implementing them (1 hour)
### 10\11
- Received advice from the supervisor, realized that the initial code implementation has made things a bit too complicated, and planning to redesign the implementation. It may be possible to use actual numbers directly instead of simulating a run. (1.5 hours)
### 10\15
- Starting rewrite the implementation code(2 hours)
### 10\16
- Keep on implementing order code (1.5 hour)
### 10\17
- Finised implementing order code (2 hours)
### 10\18
- Initiated the CSS design process, focusing on constructing the basic framework to resemble the original SOLIDAC design. This involved creating a layout with four frames to form the basic template of SOLIDAC. 
### 10/19
- Designed a rectangular frame to include three panels, positioned using Flexbox to gradually populate the components within. Initially, a graphic clock was placed on the leftmost panel, serving no practical purpose. 
### 10/20
- Updated the graphic clock to a functional real-time clock after exploring CSS methods. Began the design of the middle panel but faced challenges due to the absence of clear images, resorting to designing based on older pictures. 
### 10/21
- Implemented the first set of 21 sliding components in the middle panel, hypothesizing their potential linkage with a row of indicator lights based on older images. 
### 10/22
- Created three rows of indicator lights, with the functionality that pressing a button in the sliding components beneath the middle row of lights would illuminate the corresponding light above. 
### 10/23
- After a consultation with the supervisor, received detailed design diagrams and the initial code files, prompting a revision of the previous designs according to the new information. This involved disconnecting the button-light linkages and removing listener functionalities.
### 10/24
- Modified the design of the last row of bulbs to transform them into buttons as per the new design diagrams.
### 11/3
- Foucus on the design of wireframe, alomost finished all the design.
### 11/9
- start the implementation of arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, and shifts, ensuring they handle edge cases correctly, especially around overflows and underflows. 
### 11/20
- Finished the implementation of arithemetic operation.
### 11/25
- Labeling of components like buttons and knobs. 
### 11/27
- Reading the paper try to figure out the initial order.
### 12/015
- Implementing visual feedback for register changes and machine operations, such as dynamic indicator lights and animations, to visually represent machine states. 
### 12/11
- Reading the paper try to figure out the initial order.
### 12/18
- Try to rewrite the instruction code based on the initial order.
### 01/08
- The instruction is still not functioning, need to read the paper again.
### 01/15
- Connect the rotary switches with the indicator lights
### 01/22
- The first instruction order is worked! but still need more improvement
### 01/29
- Trying to figure out which part of the machine is used to store the note , didnt mentioned a lot in paper.
### 02/06
- Working on web API, try to store the node in register and use a loop to call the function, thinking about how to control the frequency of the node.
### 02/10
- Successfully output the audio!!!!
### 02/15
- Writing the main.js as unit tests.
### 02/18
- Finished all the related implementation, basically stop coding, and starting writing dissertation
