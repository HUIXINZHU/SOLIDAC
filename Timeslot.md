### 09\18
- Learining how to  build an emulator (1.5 hours)
### 09\19
- Search for information about SOLIDAC(1 hour)
### 09\20
- Learning about CPU instruction execution, arithmetic and logic operations, as well as how the CPU interacts with other hardware.(2 hours)
### 09\21
- First meeting with supervisor, asked about the function of SOLIDAC (1hour)
### 09\26
- Finish reading the first fifty pages of the literature, and I have gained a general understanding of the components, functionality, and the initial purpose of constructing SOLIDAC. (3 hours)
### 09\27
- Continuing to review the literature on SOLIDAC, and documenting points of uncertainty and intend to raise them during my next meeting with the supervisor. (2 hours)
### 09\28
- Thinking about implementation plan, keep reading the matrials of SOlIDAC (1.5 hours)
### 09\29
- Draw a GUI frontend diagram of the system and try to determine the inputs and outputs of SOLIDAC (1.5 hours)
### 10\01
- Try to figure out the out put of each switch, they only mentioned in material when they were used, think about how to implement the clock
  CPU. (1 hour)
### 10\02
- Decide to bulid a web based program and learn more about the content of JavaScript.(1 hour)
### 10\04
- Thinking about how to write a simple function to interpret instructions. (30mins)
### 10\06
- Learning how to build a simple interpreter in https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part2/ (2 hours)
### 10\09
- Starting implement order code (1 hour)
### 10\10
- Finished first two orders.start from B-reg to store. (1 hour)
- Asked supervisor about how do the switches and indicator lights work, and thinking about how to link all the methods to the interface after implementing them (1 hour)
### 10\11
- Received advice from the supervisor, realized that the initial code implementation has made things a bit too complicated, and planning to redesign the implementation. It may be possible to use actual numbers directly instead of simulating a run. (1.5 hours)
### 10\15
- Starting rewrite the implementation code(2 hours)
### 10\16
- Keep on implementing order code (1.5 hour)
