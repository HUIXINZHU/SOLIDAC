## First Meeting 9\21\2023
The first meeting with my supervisor, Jeremy Singer, involved discussing the project's timeline and the tasks to be completed at 
different stages. We established a regular weekly meeting schedule. Professor Singer provided materials about SOLIDAC and identified 
things to be completed before next meeting, as well as topics to be discussed.

Discussed the initial emulator design with the professor and raised some questions about the project. Jeremy provided additional materials 
on SOLIDAC and offered suggestions and ideas for the project. Here are some feedbacks from this meeting:
- Complete the reading of materials before the next meeting.
- Draw a component diagram.
- Decide whether to create a web-based application or a standalone app.
- Begin thinking about the implementation plan.
